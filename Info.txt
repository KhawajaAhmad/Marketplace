What is Heroku?
Heroku is a distributed hosting service that allows your application to be run and accessed by users using dynos.

What is a dyno?
A dyno is a Heroku version of a server. Dynos run your application on a virtual machine and hence there are a few limitations as well. For instance, 
if you want to improve you application's performance by adding a caching layer, you can't do it using dyno.

Note:
Heroku uses uWSGI to run Flask apps. Moreover, Heroku provides security using SSL.
